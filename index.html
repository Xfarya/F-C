          <h1>about me</h1>
          Without a doubt, purpose-driven environments motivate me most, whether that be big ideas, or smaller technical tasks. I believe that tech could provide us with much more transparent and useful desired outcomes when we look to tackle questions of inequality, and matters of sustainability.
<br /><br />
      I was first interested in learning to code whilst working in the non-profit sector, where I would encounter various problems that I felt could be solved with the aid of technology.
<br /><br />
      I have since learnt syntaxes for HTML, CSS and JS (also recently started Ruby) using online resources such as Codecademy, freeCodeCamp, Codewars and Udemy among many others. I have also built and uploaded to GitHub a BlackJack game (link provided) on a static website. I am really proud of my progress so far, and feel I have come a long way even though I know this is just the beginning!
<br /><br />
      My career aspirations are to work for an organisation that is purpose-driven and focused on these issues. One such idea I am currently interested in which is related to community and issues of inequality, is to look at a possible adoption of large-scale ‘pay-what-you-can’ models for everyday items such as groceries.
<br /><br />
      Overall, I am hoping to find a community in Founders & Coders. I feel that speaking in terms of ‘talent’ has only proven to be relatively useful. Whilst ‘technically’ true that anyone can learn to code independently, this assertion seems somewhat incomplete when it overlooks the important role that communities and support networks play in the success of any individual. In this regard, learning to code is simply not enough, but harboring important relationships with people in teams, and forming communities to which you can also then later contribute, is what I feel will ultimately ensure that we create lasting and meaningful projects.
<br /><br />
      In regards to intersectionality and it’s vital importance when we envisage the future of the tech sector I have found there to be a gaping disparity when it comes to those collectively termed as “minorities”. In one way, it shows that we still have a long way to go in terms of countering gendered and racial biases. Yet in another more exciting and optimistic way, it also shows how there are still so many possibilities, radically different experiences and ways of seeing the world yet to be explored.
<br /><br />
      We need to both be, and to also surround ourselves with people who have the determination to change things, and the drive to create opportunities for empowerment through increased access and representation. Only then can we truly look to creating technologies that better represent and empower us all. I feel Founders & Coders aligns with a lot of these ideas, and this is why I would like to be considered for your Autumn 2021 cohort. :)
<br /><br />
      Thank you for your time!
