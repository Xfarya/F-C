<p id = "aboutme"> I started regularly learning to code in early December 2020.
<br><br>
Since then, I have learnt syntaxes for HTML, CSS and JS (also recently started Ruby) using online resources. I have also built a BlackJack game (link provided) on a static website.
<br><br>
I am really proud of my progress so far even though I know this is just the beginning!
<br><br>
Without a doubt, purpose-driven environments motivate me most, whether that be big ideas, or smaller technical tasks. I come from a background in international development, and have volunteered, worked and/or studied in several places, most recently Greece, Iraq and Egypt. Learning to code first caught my attention when I would try to think of ways in which we could find solutions to various problems in the non-profit sector (ranging from data-entry, to translations, to efficiency, to communications, to accountability and advocacy!). I felt that many of these could be solved if we had more targeted apps that were dedicated to suit our purposes. I started learning HTML and CSS using Codecademy, and tried to encourage the beneficiaries to do so also. On reflection, a combination of a lack of confidence/motivation on their part, and a lack of know-how on ours, the idea ultimately floundered.

                <br><br>Since then, my progress has been relatively organic, and it is at this stage I feel ready to delve much deeper to develop a more holistic understanding of the broad sector.
